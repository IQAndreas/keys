For everyone's benefit, I would strongly recommend encryption if you are going to send me passwords, credit card numbers, or other sensitive information. 

My public keys can be found on the following page:

 * [My PGP (or GPG) and SSH Keys](/keys/)

### <a id="new-to-gpg"></a>New to GPG?

[GPG](https://www.gnupg.org/) is easy once you get the hang of it, but has a bit of a learning curve, and although [there are GUI tools out there](https://www.enigmail.net/home/index.php), it still requires a higher skill level with computers. If you are less proficient with computers, contact me (without sending any sensitive information) and we can work out another method of transferring information between each other securely.

If you are comfortable with computers, but have never used email encryption before, I would recommend starting with the following guide created by the Free Software Foundation:

 * [Email Self-Defense - a guide to fighting surveillance with GnuPG encryption](https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org/en/)

To supplement your learning after that, plenty of tutorials can be found online by searching for [`GPG tutorial`](https://www.google.com/search?q=gpg+tutorial). I haven't found one specific tutorial that I find explains GPG perfectly (I'm a bit finicky as I prefer understanding the tools rather than just going through a step by step guide on how to perform a specific task with them), but after you go through enough of them, eventually you pick up pieces of information and understanding from one tutorial that were missing or unclear in another tutorial.

### <a id="verifying-fingerprints"></a>Verifying fingerprints

The "easy to read" fingerprint for my GPG key is `8BBB 5F64`, and the full fingerprint is:

```
E82F 46DD 8613 3D80 FDB8  A797 0E20 7194 8BBB 5F64
```

The fingerprint can be compared with the (hopefully same) fingerprint listed on the following pages:

 * [@IQAndreas on Twitter](https://twitter.com/IQAndreas/status/514481921007448064)
 * [Andreas Renberg on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/iqandreas/posts/826072597413476)

If you are very paranoid about security, (who knows, maybe the both the fingerprint and keys are being altered by a [man in the middle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack), meaning this website and the key listed on it has been compromised) you can call me on the telephone to verify the fingerprint.

I'm not going to list the phone number or post address on this website, as anyone who compromises the key listed on this page is also going to compromise the telephone number listed on here. If you have received a business card from me, use the number listed on that.

Alternatively, a telephone number or other form of contact information can be looked up using "more secure methods" by searching for one of the following:

 * The company I work for, _"Med Tech Sweden, Inc."_ in _Geneseo, Illinois, USA_
 * At the address of _"Bo Renberg"_ in _Degerfors, Sweden_


### <a id="key-signature-policy"></a>Key Signature Policy (Certification Practice Statement)

I will not be signing anyone else's public keys until I have grown more familiar with GnuPG and the PGP web of trust system.
